  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>I was born in Missouri, moved around quite a bit to different states (and even a different country), and for the past 10+ years have been proud to call St. Pete my home. I recently graduated from the <a href="https://www.usfsp.edu/home/"> University of South Florida </a> with my bachelor's degree in marketing. In and outside of work, as mentioned above, I love being doing anything that requires creativity: writing, video editing, and brainstorming/proposing new ideas. I look forward to finding new ways to get involved with St. Pete's dynamic businesses, entrepreneurial individuals, and ever-growing community.</p>
