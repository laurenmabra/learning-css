     <br> <p> </body>Photography has always interested me. I’ve always wanted to pursue it, but it just never made it to the top of my to do list. I do have experience taking pictures but, like most people, only with "point and shoot" cameras and my iPhone. Of course, I can still take beautiful pictures that way but I'm really interested in learning about the specifics such as exposure, aperture, shutter speed, and ISO just to name a few. </p>

      <h3> <div id="for-prof"> For Professional Development </div> </h3>
      <p>Photography would be fun just as a hobby but it would also really help me in my career. A major part of what I do is content creation. So many of the individuals and businesses that I’ve worked with wanted me to do social media/content marketing but have zero content! I have found this to be a major pinpoint of businesses (especially smaller, local companies). When I learn photography, I will be able to offer this as an additional service. Clients who don’t have a process set up for capturing unique pictures and videos will no longer have to resort to overused stock photography. I’ll be their all-in-one social media content expert.</p>
      
      <h3> <div id="just-for-fun"> Just for Fun </div> </h3>
    <p>In and outside of my job, I have a passion for creating. Picking up photography will just serve as another outlet and tool for me to create more no matter where I am. With that being said, understanding photography will play major role in capturing moments and memories while traveling.</p>
